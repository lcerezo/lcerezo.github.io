Professionally, I've worked in technology since 1998 serving a variety of roles, from desktop support, sysadmin around the globe, SRE work operating the payment gateway to the largest QSR on the planet (at the time...) to my current TAM/EAE work at AWS.

Today I'm at AWS helping organizations find operational efficiencies and build continuous resiliency in the cloud. This work ranges from architectural improvements such as resiliency & o11y, business and operational process improvements, cost optimization and more.
