Professionally, I've worked in technology since 1998 serving a variety of roles, from desktop support, to my current TAM/EAE work.

I currently work at AWS helping organizations find operational efficiencies in the cloud. This work ranges from architectural improvements such as resiliency & o11y, business and operational process improvements, cost optimization and more.
