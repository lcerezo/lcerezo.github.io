Professionally, I've worked in technology since 1998 serving a variety of roles, from desktop support, to my current SRE work.

I currently work at AWS helping organizations find operational efficiencies in the cloud. This work ranges from architectural improvements such as resiliency & o11y, business and operational process improvements, cost optimization and more. 
Until [then...](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luiscerezo/) or --> [resume]({% link _pages/resume.md %}).


Personally, I love photography, design, coffee, and the list changes often. I love to learn new things, and hope to be a student until the day I die.

There are links at the bottom for the normal social media things. Follow me there if you really want to know more.
