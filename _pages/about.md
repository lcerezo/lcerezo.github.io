Professionally, I've worked in technology since 1998 serving a variety of roles, from desktop support, to my current SRE work.

I currently work at PLXIS, building system infrastructure on a small team of extremely talented engineers who are dedicated to the craft. This is an incredible place to work, and I have not once dreaded a Monday since I started here, and will be sad once the day comes to move on. Until [then...](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luiscerezo/) or you can look at my [resume]({% link _pages/resume.md %}).


Personally, I love photography, design, coffee, and the list changes often. I love to learn new things, and hope to be a student until the day I die.

There are links at the bottom for the normal social media things. Follow me there if you really want to know more.
