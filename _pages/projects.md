### Shameless plugs for referral credits. We both win with coupons like these.


#### Google Fi 
Google Fi (formerly project fi) is Google's MVNO, Google buys data and time from major provider's towers and resells them. It is a pay-as-you-go, pay-only-for-what-you-use program.

Why I like them:

* Coverage is better than any other single operator. The service uses T-mobile, Sprint and US-Cellular towers in the US, and switches to the tower with the best reception.
* International roaming is charged the same per GB fee ($10) as in the USA. 
* You can add a data-only sim at no additional charge for other devices, including mobile hot-spots at the same per-GB rate.

Now the data charge program, isn't for everyone, but it works well for many, and if you are traveling internationally, it's a god send.

Here's a 20$ credit, (I'll also get 20$ if you use them) to start out.

#### Digital Ocean

Easy as pie cloud provider.

Why I like them:

* simple vm instance launches that are really reliable and cheap, with a public IP. As low as 5$ mo.
* Great support documents

Here's a 10$ credit. [10$ digital ocean credit coupon](https://m.do.co/c/9af287b2fea8)
