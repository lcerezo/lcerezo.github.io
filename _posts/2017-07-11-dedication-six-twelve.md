A [dedication six twelve](https://dedication6twelve.github.io) inspired update


----

# how did do?

Healthy eating? Total fail whale.

Spirit: feeling good. I'm in Chicago working on a project and we are making really good progress on our project and our team is growing together which is really great to see.

# highlight of the day?

the work groove we were in before lunch.

# How do I feel?

Really good. I ate a heavy lunch and it's sitting in me wrong. I miss vegetables!


Bonus:

A pretty wild and busy day. I still got to chat with my wife on text a bit during the day which always makes business travel a little easier.
