# A message of thanks.

It's the time of year where we reflect on the things we are grateful for. There are a lot of things to be grateful for, so here is a short list of some of them. There is no way for me to list them all.

* A great job I enjoy doing every day
* A career where I learn every day.
* Working with people I respect and learn from, and I can call my friends.
* My family.
* My country.
* My health.
* I live in relative safety and security.
* I don't suffer hunger
* I have few wants unfulfilled.
* My dogs.
* My friends.
* My lovely wife and best friend, Leslie.


Happy Thanksgiving everyone!
