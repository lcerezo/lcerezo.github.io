## A quick update

### That screen!
#### resolutions

I'm still playing with the screen resolution. In Fedora 27, The scaling is only in whole integers, and shows you a choice of 100%, 200%, or 300% scaling. For me, 100% is too small, and 200% is too large. It's a classic goldilocks problem. luckily for me, and wonderful people of the opensource world, I'm not alone. There is a setting for gnome you can adjust to enable fractional scaling.

` gsettings set org.gnome.mutter experimental-features "['scale-monitor-framebuffer']"`

will get you:

I'm playing back and forth between 150% and 175%. This also seemed to releive some of the eyestrain and dizziness I was experiencing.

# you can't touch this, but you can touch that.

I've noticed that some windows in the UI do not respond to window movements using the touch screen. Terminal app seems to work fine, firefox and chrome do not. I suspect this has to do with wayland native apps, but this is a WAG. I'll post more as I know more.

### Battery

This battery kicks ass. On a Saturday, I was surfing, and running through the selinuxgame.org, which mainly consists of troubleshooint vagrant virt hosts. While I was not on the laptop all day non stop, I was tinkering and doing my tiki tiki from early in the morning until after the closing ceremonies. (That panda!)

### hw

I have been quite impressed with the hardware. The keyboard is great. Screen is bright, all seem to work fine, with few issues. The disk is fast. The model is
```
[lcerezo@elchupin lcerezo.github.io]$ cat /sys/class/nvme/nvme0/model
KXG50ZNV512G NVMe TOSHIBA 512GB         
[lcerezo@elchupin lcerezo.github.io]$
```

### Firmware

Firmware updates are a breeze. I got an update in the packagaes applet, and rebooted the machine. All the components appear to be supported

### suspend
Suspend has historically been a problem with linux. This one just works, and works well.
