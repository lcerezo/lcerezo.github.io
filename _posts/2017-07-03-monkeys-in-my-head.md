### Damn monkeys

I woke up naturually this morning at 0556. I say "naturally" because I woke up not because of digital alerts, or [furry](https://500px.com/photo/8239680/pogo-by-luis-cerezo) alarm clocks. I woke up feeling rested and in good spirits. So I decided to drink a big glass of water, let the dogs out, and meditate for ten minutes on the back porch. If you have read any good books on modern meditation, such as [Search Inside Yourself](https://siyli.org/resources/category/siy-book) you will be well aware of the strategies to overcome the monkey mind. Acknowledge the thought as a thought, and let it pass. 
Here are *some* of the things my monkey threw on the mental wall today.

> I can smell my neighbor smoking her morning smoke. how long has she smoked? how much did her basement gut and finish cost? It took like 10 months..

... that's a thought. bring back the focus to your breath. 

> It's pretty cool right now. I need to patch the plaster. What was that epoxy called for plaster and lattice repairs again?

... that's a thought. bring back the focus to your breath.

> Yea, that was it. That book said to acknowledge the thought as a thought and focus on your breath. is this a thought? is this a thought about a thought, or is this merely a meta thought? is this meta? meta-meta thought?

... that's definitely a thought.  

> ahhh fuckit.

4:37s close enough.. this monkey wants coffee. 


How is your monkey mind?
